## â˜•Coffee Company Landing Pageâ˜•

This is a landing page for a fake coffee company I made up.

You can check it out ðŸ‘‰[here](https://ellereeeee.github.io/busan-roasters/).

## Motivation

I created this website to practice designing and using the design tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

My goal was to make to a simple and clean design with efficient color contrast and great readability.

I wanted the site to appeal to young, hip professionals who love coffee.
